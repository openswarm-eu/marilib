## Overview:
This is the setup for Mari gateway.

## Hardware:
- nRF5340
- Raspberry Pi 5 

## Getting Started
### Step 1: Flash Operating System to the micro-SD card

Depending on your computer operating system, the installation procedure can change. 
Please follow the instruction on the Raspbian website: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

From the link above download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager.

In the Raspberry Pi Imager select:
- Device           - Raspberry Pi 5,  
- Operating System - Raspberry Pi OS (64-BIT)
- Storage          - micro-SD card 64 GO 

After flashing, insert the micro-SD into the Raspberry Pi. 
Power ON the Raspberry and connect it to a screen with an HDMI cable, and connect a mouse and a keyboard.

On the first boot of the OS you need to fill in the location and language info, username and password.

For the username type: `pi`
For the password type: `raspberry`

Then install the updates with:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Marilib repository

NOTE: this repository needs to be cloned or unzipped in `/home/pi/marilib`
```
git clone https://github.com/DotBots/marilib.git
```

### Step 3: Run Marilib 

We run marilib on the Raspberry Pi inside a systemd service
to run on boot after detecting that the gateway is connected.

Run this once to install the service on Raspberry Pi:
```
cd /home/pi/marilib/examples/raspberry-pi
sudo chmod +x setup_marilib_service.sh
source setup_marilib_service.sh
```

then reboot:

```
sudo reboot
```

To launch the TUI:

```
until tmux has-session -t marilib 2>/dev/null; do sleep 0.2; done; tmux attach -t marilib
```

### Notes:
- If the gateway port (ttyACM10) exists but is not available for 120 seconds while it should take less 
than 10 seconds for it to be available, the service will stop and wil not restart so you should
check connectivity and reboot.
- It will take some seconds for the TUI to launch as the gateway port is being prepared.
- Do not plug the nRF or turn it on while the Raspberry Pi (rPi) is on, always plug in and 
turn it onwhen the rPi is turned off.
- Do not unplug the nRF or turn it off directly, you need to eject it or remove it when the 
Raspberry Pi is off or you will cause damage to the rPi and unpredicted 
behavior when running the TUI (it will crash).
- On boot, If you get a message that the gateway was ejected even though it is on, reboot ``` sudo reboot ```;  
as in this the TUI won't connect to the gateway because the gateway ejected itself or the rPi didn't shut down correctly 
so the gateway won't be seen until you reboot.
- Always always use ``` sudo shutdown -h now ``` to turn off the Raspberry Pi, if you unplug the power cable manually you will
corrupt the rPi and cause unpredicted behavior.
